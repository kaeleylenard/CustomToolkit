# Overview

Today we have a vast ecosystem of toolkits and frameworks to draw (pun intended, sort of.) upon when building a software user interface. Frameworks like Angular and React rely upon layers of abstraction to render visual components to a particular viewstate. While these abstractions make it possible for us to quickly build powerful user interfaces, they mask the underlying logic required to perform the most basic interactions. In this assignment, we will be peeling back the layers to improve our understanding of the fundamental logic that make graphical widgets work.
